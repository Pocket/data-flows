Just a few weeks ago, she photographed the tree with the northern lights behind it, she said.<\/p><p nodeIndex=\"143\">On Friday, the Northumberland National Park Authority mourned the loss of the tree and said it would work with the National Trust and others &ldquo;to consider opportunities and make plans for the site and the tree.&rdquo;<\/p><p nodeIndex=\"144\">&ldquo;We are still coming to terms with loss of the tree at Sycamore Gap and we are deeply touched by all the messages and support we have received,&rdquo; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk\/sycamore-gap-update\/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" nodeIndex=\"422\">the authority said<\/a>.<\/p><p nodeIndex=\"145\">Jamie Driscoll, the mayor of the North of Tyne Combined Authority, said the tree was part of the soul of people in the north of England. When he visited the fallen tree on Thursday, he said he noticed that the cuts in the tree were perfect, and appeared to have been made using a heavy-duty chain saw that was at least 28 inches long.<\/p><\/div><aside aria-label=\"companion column\" nodeIndex=\"423\"><\/aside><\/div><div nodeIndex=\"147\"><div nodeIndex=\"148\"><p nodeIndex=\"149\">&ldquo;It requires an awful lot of premeditation to do something like that,&rdquo; Mr. Driscoll said. &ldquo;This is not just young, stupid drunk people keying someone&rsquo;s car.&rdquo;<\/p><p nodeIndex=\"150\">The tree stood along a dip in Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall, which was built by the Roman Army after the emperor Hadrian&rsquo;s visit to Britain in A.D. 122. The wall, which spans 73 miles, was the frontier of the Roman Empire for nearly 300 years. More than one million people visit the wall each year, according to Northumberland National Park.<\/p><\/div><aside aria-label=\"companion column\" nodeIndex=\"424\"><\/aside><\/div><div nodeIndex=\"159\"><div nodeIndex=\"160\"><p nodeIndex=\"161\">Ian Sproat, an electrician and amateur <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mje_photography_ne\/?hl=en-gb\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" nodeIndex=\"425\">photographer<\/a> who lives about 40 minutes by car from the tree, said that he was &ldquo;gobsmacked&rdquo; when he heard that the tree had been chopped down and thought it was a hoax. When he arrived at the spot where the tree had stood on Thursday morning and gathered with others, his anger turned to sadness, he said.<\/p><p nodeIndex=\"162\">The tree was made famous globally by the Robin Hood movie, but for local people, he said, it was much more than that &mdash; it was a place for engagements, weddings or spreading ashes, or just somewhere to go for some peace and tranquillity. A woman near him, who said generations of her family had visited the tree, was sobbing, with her head in her hands, he said.<\/p><\/div><aside aria-label=\"companion column\" nodeIndex=\"426\"><\/aside><\/div><div nodeIndex=\"164\"><div nodeIndex=\"165\"><p nodeIndex=\"166\">Mr. Sproat recalled the nights he spent drinking coffee by the tree, photographing it under a dark sky, to clear his head.<\/p><p nodeIndex=\"167\">&ldquo;Anyone who wants to get away, you disappear in Northumberland,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and this is generally where people end up.&rdquo;<\/p><p nodeIndex=\"168\">Christopher Mele contributed reporting.<\/p><\/div><aside aria-label=\"companion column\" nodeIndex=\"427\"><\/aside><\/div><!--IMG_3-->"
